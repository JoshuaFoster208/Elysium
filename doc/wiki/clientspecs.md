### General

At the moment, the client application functions as a single room, non-authenticated chatroom. Written using the Qt Framework in C++, the project in it's current state consists of a Login Window, and a Chat Window. 

In it's current state, there is no functionality other than the rough outline of the GUI. 

### Proposed Features
* Authentication
* Profile Pictures
* Online Status List
