### Client Build Instructions

Client build progress is plug and play with Qt. Simply open the `.pro` file and click the play button. Qt will execute `qmake` and `make`, and run the application. 

If you experience any issues with Metaobject Code, typically hitting `Build->Clean All..` will fix things.
